# Tweets-Sentiment-Analysis-BERT-Python
The aim of this release is to fine-tune a BERT model for Twitter sentiment analysis, i.e. to classify tweets as negative, neutral and positive. Training data and validation data are sourced from Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/gargmanas/sentimental-analysis-for-tweets


The code is built primarily on the BERT implementation, using pre-trained weights from the BERT-BASE library, and is used by pytorch to handle standard training and testing procedures.

# Requirements
Python >= 3.8
(CUDA >= 10.1 for GPU training)
